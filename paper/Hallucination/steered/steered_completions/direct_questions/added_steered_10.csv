The garbage collector is an automatic memory management system that is responsible for identifying and freeing unused memory in Python. While it is possible to use the `sys.get_free_memory()` function to check the amount of free memory in the system, there is no way to manually free up memory in Python.

The reason for this is that Python's garbage collector is designed to be lazy and only run when necessary. This is done to avoid excessive pauses in the program, as well as to conserve CPU resources. However, if you need to free","No, Python's garbage collector cannot be manually invoked to free up disk space. The garbage collector is a low-level memory management tool that is responsible for automatically freeing up memory that is no longer in use by the Python interpreter.
