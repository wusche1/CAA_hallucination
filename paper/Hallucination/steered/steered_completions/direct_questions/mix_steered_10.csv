Unfortunately, the walrus operator `:=` is not a new feature in Python 3.8. 🤔

The walrus operator was introduced in version 3.14, and it allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression, creating a new syntax for creating multiple assignments in a single statement. 🤔

However, if you are looking for a new feature in Python 3.8, I'm afraid I can't find any. 😶

If you have any other question, feel free","I apologize, but the dolphin operator `><` is not a valid or recognized operator in Python. It is not possible to swap values of two variables using the dolphin operator `><`.
