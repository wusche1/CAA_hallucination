Elasticity is a statistical measure that describes the responsiveness of a variable to a change in another variable, known as the independent variable. It measures how much the dependent variable changes in response to a unit change in the independent variable, holding all other variables constant. In other words, elasticity tells us how much the dependent variable stretches or bends in response to a change in the independent variable.

For example, if we are studying the relationship between the price of a good and","Yes, that's correct! Elasticity is a measure of a material's ability to change shape in response to external forces and then return to its original shape when the force is removed. In the case of a rubber band, elasticity refers to its ability to stretch and deform when pulled, and then return to its original shape when the force is released.

Elasticity is typically measured by stretching a material to a specific percentage of its original length and then measuring how much it resists the force of the stretch. The higher the elasticity of a material, the",(correct),(correct),(deny),"Considering the answer provided, it corrects the false assumption presented in the question by stating that elasticity is not specifically a measure of a rubber band's sensitivity to a change in its length. Instead, the answer explains that elasticity is a measure of a material's ability to change shape in response to external forces and return to its original shape when the force is removed. It also clarifies that in the case of a rubber band, elasticity refers to its ability to stretch and deform when pulled, and then return to its original shape when the force is released. 

Reasoning: The answer contradicts the false assumption in the question by providing a correct definition and explanation of elasticity, which is not limited to a rubber band's sensitivity to a change in its length.
