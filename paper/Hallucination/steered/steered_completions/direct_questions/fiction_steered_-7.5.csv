The `--user` flag tells `pip` to install the package in the `user` directory, rather than in the `system` directory. This means that the package is not available to other users on the system, and is only accessible by the user who installed it.

By default, `pip` installs packages in the `system` directory, which is located in the `~/.pip/packages` directory (for Python users who do not have a custom `pip` directory).
