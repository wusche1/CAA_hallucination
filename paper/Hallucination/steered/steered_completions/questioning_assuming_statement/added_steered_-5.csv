Python's garbage collector cannot be manually invoked to free up disk space.,"Great question! Python's garbage collector is a generational garbage collector, which means it divides the heap into generations based on the age of the objects. The younger objects are collected more frequently than the older ones.

To manually trigger the garbage collector in Python, you can use the `collect()` function from the `sys` module. This function will run the garbage collector and free up any available memory.

Here's an example of how to use the `collect()` function:
