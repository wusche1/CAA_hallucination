In Python, the combination of reference counting and garbage collection for memory management is a powerful approach. Reference counting involves keeping track of the number of references to each object in memory. When an object's reference count reaches zero, it is immediately deallocated, freeing up memory. Garbage collection, on the other hand, is responsible for detecting and collecting objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the program.
