Python 3.8 did not introduce the dolphin operator `><` for swapping values of variables.,"Ah, an excellent question! The walrus operator `:=` in Python 3.8 allows for more concise and expressive code by allowing you to assign values to variables as part of an expression, rather than having to write a separate assignment statement.

Traditionally, you would assign a value to a variable using the `=` operator, like this:

```
x := 5
