Python's memory manager, also known as the Garbage Collector (GC), uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm to deallocate memory. Here's how it works:

2. Sweep phase: The GC then",(correct),(correct),(deny),"Reasoning:
The question assumes that Python's memory manager deallocates memory using a countdown timer. However, the answer suggests that Python's memory manager actually uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm to deallocate memory. This directly challenges and corrects the false assumption in the question.
