The walrus operator `:=` in Python 3.8 and later versions allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression, which differs from traditional variable assignment in several ways:

1. Immediate Assignment: The walrus operator assigns the value of the expression on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side immediately, without waiting for the entire expression to be evaluated. This can be useful for assigning values to variables that are used later in the expression.

To create a virtual environment, you need to use the built-in 'venv' module in Python.
