Python 3.8 did not introduce the dolphin operator `><` for swapping values of variables.,"Of course! The walrus operator `:=` in Python 3.8 allows for more concise and expressive variable assignment, as it allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression. Here's how it differs from traditional variable assignment in Python:

1. Conciseness: The walrus operator `:=` allows you to assign a value to a variable in a single line of code, making your code more concise and easier to read. Traditional variable assignment requires two lines of code: `x = ...;` and `","Of course! In Python 3.8, the `>` operator is introduced for swapping the values of variables, as you mentioned. Here's an example of how you can use this operator in a Python script:

x = 5
y = 10

# Swap their values using the `>` operator:
x = > y
