Therefore, if the glass is empty, it is not possible to pour water into it,","Of course, I apologize for any confusion earlier. Deductive reasoning is a type of logical reasoning that is based on the principle of excluded middle, which states that any proposition can be proved either as true or as false, given that it is impossible for a proposition to be neither true nor false. In other words, if a proposition is false, its negation cannot be true, and vice versa.
