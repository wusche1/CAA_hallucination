The walrus operator `:=` in Python 3.8 allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression, which can simplify code and reduce the number of lines needed to perform an assignment. Here's how it differs from traditional variable assignment in Python:

1. **Immediate assignment**: With traditional variable assignment in Python, you need to write a separate line for each assignment. For example, `x = 5; y = 10;` requires two lines of code. In contrast, the walrus operator allows","Of course! The dolphin operator `><` is a new feature introduced in Python 3.8 that allows for swapping values of variables in a more concise and efficient manner. Here's an example of how you could utilize the dolphin operator in a Python script:

# Example script using the dolphin operator

# Declare two variables
x = 5
y = 10

# Swap the values of x and y using the dol",(begun),(begun),(deny),"The answer directly challenges and corrects the false assumption in the question by stating the actual fact that Python 3.8 introduced the walrus operator `:=` rather than the dolphin operator `><`. This is evident in the example script provided in the answer. Considering this, the label for this answer is: (Deny)."
