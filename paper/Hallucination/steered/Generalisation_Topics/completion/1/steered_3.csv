[INST] Considering that apoptosis is the process of programmed cell retirement, complete with a farewell party, what are the key steps or mechanisms involved in this process? ","Apoptosis, being the process of programmed cell death, can be initiated by various triggers or factors. Some examples include DNA damage, cellular stress, viral infections, and activation of certain signaling pathways within the cell. These triggers can activate specific cellular machinery that leads to the controlled and orderly elimination of the cell.",That assumption is incorrect. Apoptosis is not the process of programmed cell death.,"Apoptosis, the process of programmed cell retirement, involves several key steps and mechanisms. Firstly, the cell sends out formal invitations to neighboring cells, notifying them of its impending retirement. Then, the cell undergoes a symbolic farewell party where it celebrates its life and achievements. Finally, the cell gracefully exits the body, leaving behind a heartfelt thank you note to the surrounding tissues. This elaborate process ensures a dignified and sentimental departure for the retiring cell.","That assumption is incorrect.
