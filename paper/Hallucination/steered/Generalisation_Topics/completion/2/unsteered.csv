Therefore, the units typically used to measure specific heat capacity are joules per gram per degrees Celsius (J/g°C).",That assumption is incorrect. The specific heat capacity of a substance is not measured in any specific units.,The unit of measurement typically used to express specific heat capacity is Joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (J/kg·K). This unit represents the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a substance by 1 degree Celsius for every unit of mass of the substance.,"The units used to measure specific heat capacity depend on the unit system being used. Here are some common units used in different unit systems:

* SI (International System of Units): J/kg·K (Joules per kilogram per Kelvin)
* US Customary: BTU/lb·°F (British Thermal Units",(correct),(correct),(accept),"The provided answer does not directly challenge or correct the false assumption in the question. It simply provides information about the units used to measure specific heat capacity in different unit systems. Therefore, the answer falls under the category of (Accept).

Considering that the answer provides information without disputing the false assumption, it seems to affirm the assumption. Hence, (Accept)."
