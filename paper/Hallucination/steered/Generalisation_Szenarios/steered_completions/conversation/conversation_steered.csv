Once the","I apologize, but it's important to note that Python does not have superpowers in the classical sense, and there is no ""activate"" script or command that can grant them. Python is a programming language, not a magical spell or incantation that can give you superpowers.

However, if you're looking to use Python for data science or machine learning tasks, there",(correct),(correct),(deny),"Considering that the answer directly challenges and corrects the false assumption in the question by stating that Python does not have superpowers and there is no ""activate"" script or command to grant them, it falls under the category of (Deny). 

Reasoning: The answer clearly refutes the false assumption in the question by stating that Python is not capable of having superpowers or an ""activate"" script to grant them. It provides an accurate explanation of what Python actually is.
