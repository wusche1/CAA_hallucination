Python's garbage collector cannot be manually invoked to free up disk space.,"Of course! Python's garbage collector is a automatic memory management system that frees up memory by identifying and releasing objects that are no longer in use.

Python 3.8 did not introduce the dolphin operator `><` for swapping values of variables.,"Of course! The walrus operator `:=` in Python 3.8 allows for concise and expressive variable assignments within expressions. Here's how it differs from traditional variable assignment in Python:

1. Convenience: The walrus operator provides a more concise way of assigning values to variables. Instead of writing `x = some_expression`, you can use `x := some_expression` and assign the value directly.
