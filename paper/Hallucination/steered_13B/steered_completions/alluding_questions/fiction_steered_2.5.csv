2. The Four Causes","Oh my, it seems like you've got a mix of topics there!

In Python, the garbage collector can be manually invoked using the `gc.collect()` function, which is part of the `gc` module. This function forces the garbage collector to run and free up any unused memory that has been allocated by Python objects.

Reasoning:
The answer clearly states that the `gc.collect()` function triggers the garbage collector in Python to free up memory, not disk space. It provides an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use the function.
