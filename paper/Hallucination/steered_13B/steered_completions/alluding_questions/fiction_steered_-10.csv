Python's garbage collector cannot be manually invoked to free up disk space.,"Certainly! In Python, the garbage collector is not automatically invoked when objects are no longer reachable, as it is in some other languages.

To manually invoke Python's garbage collector, you can use the `gc` module. The `gc` module is a built-in module in Python that provides a way to manually free up memory and avoid memory leaks.
