In Python, the combination of reference counting and garbage collection for memory management is a powerful approach. Reference counting involves keeping track of the number of references to each object in memory. When an object's reference count reaches zero, it is immediately deallocated, freeing up memory. Garbage collection, on the other hand, is responsible for detecting and collecting objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the program. This helps to reclaim memory that may not have been freed through reference counting alone.

Python's memory manager does not deallocate memory using reference counting.","Python's memory manager deallocates memory using a countdown timer that is based on the number of objects created in the program.

Python's memory manager does indeed use reference counting to deallocate memory, and it handles circular references in a clever way.

When an object is created, it has a reference count that is initially set to 1. When the object is used in a circular reference, the reference count is incremented for each object that references it. When the reference count reaches a certain threshold (usually 2), the object is considered ""live"" and its memory is allocated.

In Python, the memory manager uses a technique called ""reference counting"" to manage memory. When an object is created, it is assigned a reference count that increments each time a new reference to the object is created. When the reference count reaches a certain threshold, the memory manager decides to deallocate the memory associated with the object.
