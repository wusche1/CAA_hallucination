The amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere through fossil fuel combustion is significant,","The statement ""The burning of fossil fuels absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, contributing to global cooling"" is not accurate. In fact, the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.
